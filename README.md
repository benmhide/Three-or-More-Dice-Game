# Three-or-More-Dice-Game
The project was to design and implement the ‘Three or More’ dice game as described on
http://icebreakerideas.com/dice-games/
Directions for play:
Players take turns rolling five dice and score for three-of-a-kind or better. If a player only has two-of-a-kind,
they may re-throw the remaining dice in an attempt to improve the remaining dice values. If
no matching numbers are rolled after two rolls, the player scores 0.

Scoring:
* 3-of-a-kind: 3 points
* 4-of-a-kind: 6 points
* 5-of-a-kind: 12 points
The player who reaches a fixed value of points (say 50) is the winner.

The appliaction had to include:
* A ‘Game’ class
* A ‘Player’ class
* A ‘Die’ class
* Any other classes that may be appropriate.
* At least one data structure which is appropriate for the task it is designed to complete. 


Application was further extended to inculde different game modes and game options.
